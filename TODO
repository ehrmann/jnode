Tidy up script loading code
Fix sync function
Support \ as a path delimiter
More unit tests
Write a jar, or possibly even a package.json -> js jar compiler
  Maybe even "make standalone PACKAGE=https://github.com/less/less.js/raw/master/package.json"
  Make->ant?
Same as above, but a runtime loader
  E.g. java ... <package.json URL>
